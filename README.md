    <p>Lightweight, OAuth-only gateway with a simple UI for protecting apps.</p>

<br />

TinyLinks is a minimal service that puts an OAuth login screen in front of your apps. It focuses on OAuth providers (e.g., GitHub, Google, generic OIDC) and intentionally does not support username/password or TOTP.

This project started as a customization of TinyAuth. Credit and thanks to the original author and community:
- Originally based on TinyAuth by steveiliop56 â€” https://github.com/steveiliop56/tinyauth

## Getting Started

- Configure your OAuth providers (GitHub/Google/Generic) and app settings in the environment or configuration file.
- Start the service and point your reverse proxy at the provided endpoints.

> Note: TinyLinks does not integrate with Docker labels and does not support username/password or TOTP. It is OAuth-only.
